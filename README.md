# CalDavSharp
A CalDav Server and Client Implementation Using Async API with .Net5

The goal is a to create a compliant CalDav API to work with Calendars.

This is super-duper rough and does not fully function. I will be chipping away at this one. Open to help!

Update: 5/20/21 - Works with Thunderbird Calendar.. now working on iOS/MacOS Calendar
